  about: `
  I’m an engineer who enjoys building systems that don’t just work—but scale, explain, and solve real-world problems. From developing AI-powered products to architecting backend infrastructures, I focus on creating solutions that balance complexity with clarity.

Previously, I worked on AI projects where I helped turn experimental ideas into functional, production-ready systems. Whether it’s conversational AI, knowledge graphs, or backend platforms, my strength lies in connecting the dots between AI models and robust software engineering.

I’m passionate about working in teams that value thoughtful problem-solving. If the work challenges me to think deeper and build smarter, I’m all in.
