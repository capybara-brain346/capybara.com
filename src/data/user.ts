  about: `
  Iâ€™m an engineer who enjoys building systems that donâ€™t just workâ€”but scale, explain, and solve real-world problems. From developing AI-powered products to architecting backend infrastructures, I focus on creating solutions that balance complexity with clarity.

Previously, I worked on AI projects where I helped turn experimental ideas into functional, production-ready systems. Whether itâ€™s conversational AI, knowledge graphs, or backend platforms, my strength lies in connecting the dots between AI models and robust software engineering.

Iâ€™m passionate about working in teams that value thoughtful problem-solving. If the work challenges me to think deeper and build smarter, Iâ€™m all in.
